### What is the Problem? [Good papers generally solve *a single* problem]

Existing performance debugging methods for complex distributed systems do not provide useful information about end-to-end performance characteristics, because it is challenging to construct an execution model of requests in a highly-distributed heterogeneous system. 

### Summary [Up to 3 sentences]

A Spectre attack starts by introducing a sequence of instructions (acts as covert channel transmitter that leaks the victim’s memory when executed) within the process address space. The attacker then tricks the CPU into speculatively executing this instruction sequence, thereby leaking the victim’s information.

### Key Insights [Up to 2 insights]

- Attacker mistrains the CPU’s branch predictor into mispredicting the direction of a branch with 2 phases: (1) initial mistraining with valid inputs and (2) exploit phase where an input directs to another branch direction but the CPU is already trained to do the opposite which enforces erroneous cache state.
- Attacker trains the BTB to mispredict a branch from an indirect branch instruction to the address of a detrimental gadget, resulting in speculative execution of the gadget.

### Notable Design Details/Strengths [Up to 2 details/strengths]

- When processors erroneuosly speculatively execute, it transfers confidential info via the covert channel based on the attackers request.
- After the misprediction, the attacker measures which location in array2 was brought into the cache via Prime+Probe. This reveals the value of the secret.

### Limitations/Weaknesses [up to 2 weaknesses]

- If an application is executed on separate processes, than the attack would be less effective
- Language-based protection may prevent access to program data.

### Summary of Key Results [Up to 3 results]

- This paper describes attacks that combine methodology from side channel attacks and ROP that can read arbitrary memory from the victim’s process
- Spectre induce victims to speculatively perform operations that would not occur during strictly serialized inorder processing, and which leak confidential information.

### Open Questions [Where to go from here?]

- How does changing the ISA itself allow branch prediction be exploited detrimentally?
- Is it possible to eliminate vulnerabilities in the BHT/BTB itself? (e.g. Avoid injurious training)
